# API & SDK

## REST API

The backend exposes a RESTful API built with **.NET 10**.

## SDK Generation

The project supports SDK generation using **Scalar**.

- **Scalar**: Used to generate client SDKs for various languages and platforms based on the OpenAPI/Swagger specification of the API.
- This allows for easy integration with any frontend framework or external consumer.

## Frontend Integration

This repository is **backend-only**. The API is designed to be consumed by any frontend technology (React, Vue, Angular, Mobile, etc.).
